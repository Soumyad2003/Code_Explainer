# Code_Explainer

## This project is a Python Code Explainer built using Google's Generative AI and Streamlit. The application allows users to input a Python code snippet, and it provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how the code works. Here's a brief description of the project:

### Project Description
The Python Code Explainer is a web application designed to help users understand Python code snippets by providing detailed, step-by-step explanations. The application leverages Google's Generative AI to generate these explanations, ensuring that even complex code can be broken down into understandable parts.

### Key Features
1. Code Input: Users can input their Python code snippets through a text area in the Streamlit interface.
2. Code Explanation: The application uses Google's Generative AI to analyze the input code and generate a detailed, step-by-step explanation.
3. User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit interface makes it easy for users to interact with the application, enter their code, and view the explanations.

### How It Works
* Environment Setup: The application loads environment variables, including the API key for Google's Generative AI, using the dotenv library.
* Generative AI Configuration: The Generative AI model is configured with the API key.
* Completion Function: The get_completion function takes a code snippet as input, constructs a prompt, and uses the Generative AI model to generate a detailed explanation of the code.
* Streamlit Interface: The Streamlit interface allows users to enter their code snippets and view the explanations. The interface includes a text area for code input and a button to trigger the explanation generation.

### Conclusion
The Python Code Explainer is a powerful tool for anyone looking to understand Python code better. By leveraging Google's Generative AI, the application provides detailed and accurate explanations, making it an invaluable resource for learners and developers alike.
